If the court issues an order compelling arbitration, the prevailing party on the motion to compel may recover its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.","<strong>Disputes with Customers Who Reside Outside the United States and Canada</strong>","If you do not reside in the United States or Canada, the Arbitration Agreement described above does not apply to you and you may resolve any claim you have with us relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with our Terms, us, or our Services in a court of competent jurisdiction.","General Terms","These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Toshi Holdings and you regarding the App, the Services, and any Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Toshi Holdings and you regarding the App, the Services, and any Content.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and void. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.

Applicability of Arbitration Agreement","Subject to the terms of this Coinbase Wallet Arbitration Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified and in effect from time to time, the \u201c<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>\u201d), you and Toshi Holdings agree that any dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the App, the Services, or the Coinbase Wallet Terms of Service (the \u201c<strong>Wallet ToS</strong>\u201d) and prior versions of the Wallet ToS, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of the Wallet ToS (each, a \u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and Toshi Holdings may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you or Toshi Holdings may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, \u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Wallet ToS as well as claims that may arise after the termination of the Wallet ToS. Any capitalized term used herein without definition shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the Wallet ToS.","2. Waiver of Jury Trial","YOU AND TOSHI HOLDINGS HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Toshi Holdings are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the section entitled \u201cApplicability of Arbitration Agreement\u201d above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.","3. Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief","YOU AND TOSHI HOLDINGS AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 8, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party\u2019s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 8 entitled \u201cBatch Arbitration.\u201d Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this section, \u201cWaiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,\u201d are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Toshi Holdings agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. All other Disputes that are not severed shall be litigated in small claims court or arbitrated. This section does not prevent you or Toshi Holdings from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.","4. Rules and Forum",`The Wallet ToS evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \xa7 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d), in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are currently available at ${i.sp}.`,`A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the \u201c<strong>Request</strong>\u201d). If you initiate the arbitration, you must provide Toshi Holdings a copy of your Request by email at ${i.HB} or through Toshi Holdings\u2019s registered agent for service of process. The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, email address of the party seeking arbitration, and the username and wallet addresses (if any) associated with the applicable Account(s); (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought, including an accurate, good faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) if you are the party making the Request, a statement certifying completion of the Formal Complaint Process as described in the Wallet ToS or your basis for not completing the Formal Complaint Process; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.`,"If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel\u2019s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.","Unless you and Toshi Holdings otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in section 8 is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA Rules.","You and Toshi Holdings agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties\u2019 attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.","5. Arbitrator","The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within thirty-five (35) business days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process under section 8 is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch.","6. Authority of Arbitrator","The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the Section entitled \u201cWaiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief,\u201d including any claim that all or part of the Section entitled \u201cWaiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief\u201d is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section entitled \u201cWaiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief\u201d has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the section entitled \u201cBatch Arbitration,\u201d all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in the section entitled \u201cBatch Arbitration.\u201d The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. In any award of damages, the arbitrator shall abide by the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section of the Wallet ToS.","7. Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs","The parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Toshi Holdings need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.","8. Batch Arbitration","To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Toshi Holdings agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Toshi Holdings by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (\u201c<strong>Batch Arbitration</strong>\u201d).","All parties agree that Requests are of a \u201csubstantially similar nature\u201d if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (\u201c<strong>Administrative Arbitrator</strong>\u201d). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator\u2019s fees shall be paid by Toshi Holdings.","You and Toshi agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.","This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.","9. Modification","If we make any updates to the Arbitration Agreement, we will make the updated terms available to you by publishing them on the Site. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Site following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.","10. Severability","If any provision of this Arbitration Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement shall not be affected."];var r,n=o(67209),s=o(31085);e=o.hmd(e),(r="undefined"!=typeof reactHotLoaderGlobal?reactHotLoaderGlobal.enterModule:void 0)&&r(e);"undefined"!=typeof reactHotLoaderGlobal&&reactHotLoaderGlobal.default.signature;var l,c,d={__html:a.join("<br/><br/>")};function h(){return(0,s.jsx)(n.V,{as:"div",testID:"tos-update",children:(0,s.jsx)("div",{dangerouslySetInnerHTML:d,style:{overflowWrap:"break-word",wordBreak:"break-word"}})})}(l="undefined"!=typeof reactHotLoaderGlobal?reactHotLoaderGlobal.default:void 0)&&(l.register(d,"htmlContent","/workspaces/apps/extension/src/screens/TOSUpdate/TermsOfServiceUpdate.tsx"),l.register(h,"TermsOfServiceUpdate","/workspaces/apps/extension/src/screens/TOSUpdate/TermsOfServiceUpdate.tsx")),(c="undefined"!=typeof reactHotLoaderGlobal?reactHotLoaderGlobal.leaveModule:void 0)&&c(e)},6862:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{r:()=>y});o(14041);var i=o(31944);const a=40;var r=o(91965),n=o(55799),s=o(84492),l=o(25314),c=o(31085);const d=["alignItems","paddingX","paddingY","title","onBackButtonClick","backAccessibilityLabel","backAccessibilityHint","closeAccessibilityLabel","closeAccessibilityHint"];function h(e,t){var o=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(i=i.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),o.push.apply(o,i)}return o}function u(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var o=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?h(Object(o),!0).forEach((function(t){p(e,t,o[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(o)):h(Object(o)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o,t))}))}return e}function p(e,t,o){return(t=function(e){var t=function(e,t){if("object"!=typeof e||!e)return e;var o=e[Symbol.toPrimitive];if(void 0!==o){var i=o.call(e,t||"default");if("object"!=typeof i)return i;throw new TypeError("@@toPrimitive must return a primitive value.")}return("string"===t?String:Number)(e)}(e,"string");return"symbol"==typeof t?t:t+""}(t))in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:o,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=o,e}const y=e=>{let{alignItems:t="center",paddingX:o=3,paddingY:h=2,title:p,onBackButtonClick:y,backAccessibilityLabel:f,backAccessibilityHint:b,closeAccessibilityLabel:g,closeAccessibilityHint:m}=e,A=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var o,i,a=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var o={};for(var i in e)if({}.hasOwnProperty.call(e,i)){if(-1!==t.indexOf(i))continue;o[i]=e[i]}return o}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var r=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(i=0;i<r.length;i++)o=r[i],-1===t.indexOf(o)&&{}.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,o)&&(a[o]=e[o])}return a}(e,d);const{onRequestClose:T,accessibilityLabelledBy:E,hideCloseButton:S,hideDividers:O}=(0,i.k)();if(!p&&!y&&!T)return null;const v=(0,c.jsx)(n.a,{height:a,width:a});return(0,c.jsxs)(s.z,u(u({alignItems:t,borderedBottom:!O,paddingX:o,paddingY:h},A),{},{children:[y?(0,c.jsx)(n.a,{children:(0,c.jsx)(r.K,{transparent:!0,accessibilityHint:b,accessibilityLabel:f,name:"backArrow",onClick:y,testID:"modal-back-button"})}):v,(0,c.jsx)(n.a,{alignItems:"center",flexGrow:1,justifyContent:"center",paddingX:2,children:(0,c.jsx)(l.E,{as:"h2",display:"block",font:"headline",id:E,textAlign:"center",children:p})}),!S&&(0,c.jsx)(n.a,{justifyContent:"flex-end",children:(0,c.jsx)(r.K,{transparent:!0,accessibilityHint:m,accessibilityLabel:g,name:"close",onClick:T,testID:"modal-close-button"})})]}))}}}]);
